Step 1:
Select k data points as the initial cluster centres.(Ramdomly)
Step 2:
Find the euclidean distance of each data point 
towards each cluster centres.
Step 3:
Assign each data point to the nearest cluster.
Step 4:
Recompute the new cluster centres by taking mean of the 
data points belonging to that cluster.
Step 5:
Repeat step 2 to 4.
Step 6:
Stop the process when zero convergence is reached.

End result:
You get the data points clustered into k clusters.
