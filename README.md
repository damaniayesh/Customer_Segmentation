# Customer_Segmentation
This project offers the K-means clustering algorithm to identify potential customers for the manager to target with calls, streamlining the process by focusing on specific customer groups.

# Introduction:-
Customer segmentation is the process of dividing customers into groups based on common characteristics so that companies can market to each group effectively and appropriately. Segmentation allows marketers to better tailor their marketing efforts to different categories of audiences. K-means clustering is effectively used to handle customer segmentation.

# Dataset Information:-
The dataset consist of columns like customer ID, gender of the customer, age of the customer, the annual income of the customer given to us in thousand dollars and the spending score which ranges from 1 to 100. A good spending score which is close to 100 indicates a good customer and spending score close to 1 indicates a bad customer.

# Problem Statement:-
To find out the potential customers for the manager so that he can call only those specific customers and roll out the offer to them.

# Steps for performing K_means_Clustering:-
1. Import Libraries
2. Reading Dataframe
3. Checking for missing values
4. Creating X
5. Elbow Method to find optimum value for K
6. Visualized K_means_Clustering
7. Selected Target Customers
8. Convert it to Excel (Send it to client)
